# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This guide was created to enable those who are about to begin a coding bootcamp to review the fundamental information and skills necessary to begin working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Building this has helped me learn more about Git in particular, and the way version control works in the professional coding world. This will be particularly helpful to people who are unsure where to begin learning these skills and for helping to review the foundational concepts.
